This is a trading game, inspired off a game played in my AP World History class. You start with a ship and travel across the Indian Ocean to earn money and explore. You can sail to various locations, stretching from Venice, Italy, to Hangzhou, China.


This is technically version 3.0. I first created it as a shell-based game in python, then a tkinter gui game in python, and now a website with Javascript. (I learned Javascript just for this project).
I remade the game the first time because Mr. Winnat asked me to clean the game up, and the second time because I realized tkinter guis are semi-hard to export and that school chromebooks REALLY hate running other applications.


I have learned many things (like generator functions, promises, and that I hate css). This will probably be invaluable experience for web development.
